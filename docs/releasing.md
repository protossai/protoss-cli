# Releasing Protoss CLI

Only maintainers release this repository. CLI releases and JPS specification releases are
independent: a CLI release may consume a JPS release, but it never creates or changes one.

## Prerequisites

- The intended JPS artifacts have already been committed and published under an immutable tag in
  `protossai/judgment-pack-spec`.
- GitHub Release Immutability is enabled for this repository.
- `main` is clean, pushed, and passing CI.
- The GitHub CLI is authenticated with permission to push and manage releases.
- The release version is an exact SemVer tag such as `v0.1.0` or `v0.2.0-rc.1`.
- The release workflow pins a currently supported Go toolchain independently from the minimum
  source-compatible Go version in `go.mod`; both values are reviewed deliberately.

Never release a CLI whose artifact lock says `unreleased-local-snapshot`, records a dirty source
worktree, or names a moving branch. The tag workflow independently enforces this rule.

## Refresh the bundled specification

From a clean checkout at the approved JPS tag, remove the existing destination only as part of a
reviewed artifact update, then import a new directory with the maintainer tool:

```bash
env GO111MODULE=on go run ./tools/sync-spec-artifacts \
  --source ../judgment-pack-spec \
  --destination ./internal/artifacts/jps/<exact-spec-version> \
  --source-ref <exact-jps-tag>
```

Review every imported file and `lock.json`. The lock must contain the official repository URL,
`immutable-git-ref`, the tag, its exact commit, `worktreeDirty: false`, and the expected bundle
digest. Update the embedded registry only when adding a new specification version.

## Validate locally

Install the exact GoReleaser version used by the workflow, then run:

```bash
env GO111MODULE=on go fmt ./...
git diff --check
env GO111MODULE=on go vet ./...
env GO111MODULE=on go test ./...
env GO111MODULE=on go run ./cmd/protoss spec test-conformance --quiet
env GO111MODULE=on go run ./tools/check-release --tag <cli-tag>
goreleaser check
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean
```

Inspect `dist/checksums.txt`, all six platform archives, their license files, and one extracted
binary. A release build must report the tag version without the leading `v`.

## Create the release

1. Move the changelog entries from `Unreleased` to the intended version and date.
2. Commit the reviewed release source with DCO sign-off and push `main`.
3. Create an annotated tag on that exact commit and push only that tag:

   ```bash
   git tag -s <cli-tag> -m "Protoss CLI <cli-tag>"
   git push origin <cli-tag>
   ```

   If no signing key is configured, stop and resolve the signing policy; do not silently replace a
   signed tag with an unsigned tag.

4. The tag workflow repeats the tests, verifies immutable JPS provenance, packages the binaries,
   creates `checksums.txt`, drafts the GitHub release, and attests every archive.
5. Download the draft assets, verify their checksums and attestations, and smoke-test at least one
   archive on each operating-system family.
6. Review the generated notes and publish the draft. With Release Immutability enabled, publishing
   locks the tag and assets.

Do not move or reuse a released tag. Fixes require a new version.

## User-facing verification

Users can verify a downloaded archive with the platform SHA-256 tool and `checksums.txt`. With a
current GitHub CLI they can also verify build provenance:

```bash
gh attestation verify <downloaded-archive> --repo protossai/protoss-cli
```
