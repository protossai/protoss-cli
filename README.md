`protoss` is an extensible developer command line. Its first public namespace, `protoss spec`,
provides offline, nonnormative tooling for the Judgment Pack Specification (JPS).

The CLI validates documents. It does not evaluate rules, choose an outcome, fetch a source,
authorize an action, or establish truth, organizational authority, safety, or operational fitness.

## Implemented commands

```text
protoss version
protoss spec validate <pack-or->
protoss spec test-conformance [suite]
protoss spec schema <spec-version>
```

The namespace is `protoss spec`, not `protoss jps`. JPS remains the name of the specification and
the prefix of its provisional diagnostic codes.

## Install a tagged release

Download the archive for your operating system and architecture from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/protossai/protoss-cli/releases). Each archive includes the
binary, README, Apache-2.0 license, and third-party notices.

Asset names follow this pattern:

```text
protoss_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz
protoss_<version>_windows_<arch>.zip
```

For example, release `v0.1.0` uses `protoss_0.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz`. Linux and macOS users can
extract an archive and install the binary into a user-owned directory already on `PATH`:

```bash
tar -xzf protoss_0.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
install -m 0755 protoss "$HOME/.local/bin/protoss"
protoss version
```

On Windows, expand the `.zip`, move `protoss.exe` into a directory on your user `PATH`, and run:

```powershell
protoss version
```

Verify the archive before extracting it. On Linux:

```bash
grep ' protoss_0.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz$' checksums.txt | sha256sum --check
```

On macOS:

```bash
grep ' protoss_0.1.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz$' checksums.txt | shasum -a 256 --check
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
(Get-FileHash .\protoss_0.1.0_windows_amd64.zip -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
Select-String -Path .\checksums.txt -Pattern ' protoss_0.1.0_windows_amd64.zip$'
```

The two Windows hashes must match. Release archives also carry GitHub build-provenance
attestations, which a current GitHub CLI can verify:

```bash
gh attestation verify protoss_0.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz --repo protossai/protoss-cli
```

Packages for Homebrew, Scoop, `apt`, and `go install` are not published yet. In particular, source
installation with `go install` does not receive the release linker metadata, so use a release
archive when you need an accurately reported CLI version.

## Build and try it locally

Go 1.21 or newer is required to build from source.

If an older WSL setup has persisted `GO111MODULE=off`, clear it once with
`go env -u GO111MODULE`. The commands below explicitly enable module mode as a compatibility
measure.

```bash
env GO111MODULE=on CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -o ./bin/protoss ./cmd/protoss
./bin/protoss --help
./bin/protoss version
```

From a sibling checkout of `judgment-pack-spec`, validate a synthetic example:

```bash
./bin/protoss spec validate ../judgment-pack-spec/examples/minimal-expense-approval.json
./bin/protoss spec validate --format json ../judgment-pack-spec/examples/minimal-expense-approval.json
```

Standard input is accepted explicitly with `-`:

```bash
./bin/protoss spec validate --format json - < pack.json
```

Run the exact bundled JPS `v0.1.0-draft` corpus:

```bash
./bin/protoss spec test-conformance
./bin/protoss spec test-conformance --format json
```

Inspect or copy the bundled schema without network access:

```bash
./bin/protoss spec schema 0.1.0-draft
./bin/protoss spec schema 0.1.0-draft --write schema.json
./bin/protoss spec schema 0.1.0-draft --write -
```

The schema command refuses to overwrite an existing file.

## Validation behavior

Validation short-circuits in this order:

1. strict UTF-8 JSON carrier parsing, including duplicate-member rejection;
2. exact `specVersion` dispatch;
3. Draft 2020-12 structural validation with URI, date, and date-time assertions;
4. normative semantic reference and extension-declaration checks; and
5. required-extension capability negotiation.

An unknown but syntactically usable `specVersion` is `unsupported`, not `invalid`. The conformance
runner deliberately pins each case to the suite's declared specification version, so a fixture that
violates that pinned schema remains a structural negative case.

`--through carrier` and `--through structural` produce explicitly partial results. They never print
an unqualified “valid document” message.

The public MVP supports no JPS extensions. A structurally and semantically conforming document that
requires an extension is therefore reported as `unsupported`. Extension code is never discovered,
downloaded, installed, or executed during validation.

## Process contract

| Exit | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| `0` | Command succeeded; validation passed the reported scope. |
| `1` | Document invalid, or a conformance expectation mismatched. |
| `2` | Exact JPS version or required extension unsupported. |
| `3` | Invocation or suite configuration invalid. |
| `4` | Input/output or resource-limit failure. |
| `5` | Internal CLI or bundled-artifact failure. |

`--format json` writes exactly one versioned JSON object plus a newline to standard output for
normal valid, invalid, unsupported, mismatch, and handled operational results. It never mixes human
prose or ANSI controls into that stream. Results include `diagnosticsTruncated` so automation can
detect a reached output limit. `--quiet` is available only with human output.

Human document results, including `invalid` and `unsupported`, use standard output. Invocation,
input/output, resource, and internal failures use standard error.

## Security defaults

The current implementation:

- performs no runtime network requests and never dereferences document locators;
- accepts one explicitly selected regular file or standard input, not URLs or special files;
- rejects duplicate decoded member names at every depth, invalid UTF-8, trailing JSON, and
  non-JSON constants;
- caps a document at 10 MiB, nesting at 128, parsed nodes at 250,000, and diagnostics at 100;
- caps local conformance suites at 10,000 cases and 100 MiB total;
- caps diagnostics retained across one conformance result at 1,000;
- validates suite metadata before resolving fixtures and rejects traversal and symlink paths;
- treats extension values as inert data; and
- emits sanitized, value-free human diagnostics.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting and boundary details.

## Artifact provenance

Runtime validation uses only files embedded in the binary and verified against
[`internal/artifacts/jps/0.1.0-draft/lock.json`](internal/artifacts/jps/0.1.0-draft/lock.json).
The lock records the source repository, exact commit/ref and source state, plus SHA-256 and size
metadata for all 50 imported files. A development snapshot remains visibly labelled
`unreleased-local-snapshot` and cannot pass the release gate.

Artifact bundle and conformance-corpus digests use `sha256-length-prefixed-v1`: each sorted path and
file body is encoded as an unsigned 64-bit big-endian byte length followed by those exact bytes.
The corpus digest covers `manifest.json`, `manifest.schema.json`, and every manifest fixture, so an
equivalent bundled and local corpus produces the same value. Human and JSON conformance output both
report it.

Before any CLI release, those files must be re-imported from an approved immutable specification
commit or tag. The lock must say `immutable-git-ref`, record a clean source worktree, and identify
the exact ref and commit. Mutable `main` is never a runtime validation authority.

Maintainers can create a new, initially absent snapshot directory with:

```bash
env GO111MODULE=on go run ./tools/sync-spec-artifacts \
  --source ../judgment-pack-spec \
  --destination ./internal/artifacts/jps/<exact-version> \
  --allow-dirty
```

`--allow-dirty` is deliberately required for an unreleased snapshot. A release candidate instead
uses `--source-ref <exact-commit-or-tag>`; that mode verifies the official repository origin, a
clean worktree, and that the ref resolves to checked-out `HEAD`. Artifact updates are reviewed
source changes; the runtime never runs this tool.

## Public and commercial boundaries

This repository is intended to remain a self-contained Apache-2.0 public core. It must build,
install, validate, and run its conformance tests without private repositories, credentials,
services, package indexes, or feature flags.

Commercial capabilities should live in separate private repositories; this public repository must
never depend on them. The current supported integration boundary is the `protoss` executable and
its versioned JSON output. Go packages are intentionally `internal`, and there is not yet a stable
in-process SDK or plugin API. Before commercial commands are composed into one binary, the public
project must define and version that contract deliberately. Future commands should use distinct
namespaces such as `protoss cloud` or `protoss org`; they must not override `protoss spec`
conformance semantics or auto-load during validation.

The normative specification, schemas, and public corpus remain in the separate
[`judgment-pack-spec`](https://github.com/protossai/judgment-pack-spec) repository.

## Development

```bash
env GO111MODULE=on go fmt ./...
env GO111MODULE=on go vet ./...
env GO111MODULE=on go test ./...
env GO111MODULE=on CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath ./cmd/protoss
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md), and the
[maintainer release runbook](docs/releasing.md).

In VS Code, **Terminal → Run Task → Protoss: Build CLI** builds `bin/protoss`; the test and bundled
conformance tasks are available from the same menu. The tasks explicitly enable Go module mode for
older WSL configurations.
