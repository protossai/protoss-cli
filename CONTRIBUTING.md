# Contributing

This repository implements a nonnormative tool for the Judgment Pack Specification. The tagged
specification artifacts remain authoritative when implementation behavior disagrees with them.

## Before opening a pull request

```bash
env GO111MODULE=on go fmt ./...
env GO111MODULE=on go vet ./...
env GO111MODULE=on go test ./...
env GO111MODULE=on CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath ./cmd/protoss
```

Changes should include focused tests for human and JSON output, exit status, input limits, and
adversarial behavior. Never add a runtime fetch of mutable specification branches.

Material command or output changes should first describe compatibility, migration, automation,
security, privacy, and authority consequences in an issue.

## Scope

The public core may contain generally useful developer commands, offline JPS validation, public
plugin contracts, and open integrations. Proprietary services, billing, enterprise administration,
customer-specific behavior, and private dependencies belong in separate repositories.
